# Shortsy-YouTube Shorts Generator Bot

🤖 Totally free YouTube Shorts Generator automatically using Gemini API by simply running the script

**FREE ALTERNATIVE TO OPENAI**

<h2 id='working'>🤓How it works</h2>
<h4>1. Content</h4>
Enter the theme of the video and AI will generate the content for the video automatically using Gemini API 

<h4>2. Text-to-speech</h4>
The content generated by AI is then converted to speech using gTTs and it saves the files as "speech.mp3

 <h4>3. Editing</h4>
 Video is edited using MoviePy which takes a gameplay video, trims a random part of it and add the speech generated on top of it. Then the video is resized to 9:16 ratio which is the ratio for shorts or reels.
